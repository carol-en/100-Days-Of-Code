# 100 Days of Code

Hello there! This is my own personal repo for the [**100 Days of Code**](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) Challenge! However, for my own sanity and comfort I will modifying the rules for myself. As I have _other_ obligations, errands, & skills in need of sharpening and remaining on top of things: my plan is rather than do 1 hour daily of code, do _something_ every day. At best a _**minimum**_ of 30 minutes & max of 1 hour for this challenge. But if I am not really feeling it? 5-10 minutes.

## No Zero Day
What I personally plan to do with this challenge is combine it with the concept of [**No More Zero Days**](https://medium.com/@fayadh56/the-concept-of-no-more-zero-days-and-why-motivation-is-fleeting-9c1c307f8948), and you may be asking yourself what the even means? At it's core the idea of this concept is: doing ***something*** is better than doing nothing. Even if it's, for example, reading 1 page a day, watching 1 5-minute educational video a day.

Why combine a modified version of _100 Days of Code_ challenge with _No Zero Day_? Because for me the building of the habit to do something is more important. I have many habits I want to not only build but retain. I want to get back into reading, I want to draw on a daily basis, I want to _improve_ my drawing skills, learn more  art. But also improve upon and learn more coding & technologies as well. On top of those two priorities: there's keeping myself going to the gym, and on top of **ALL THAT:** enjoying and making time for my hobbies as well as finding a little bit of me time to squeeze in. Be it to be lazy and do nothing, or do something.

## The All Or Nothing Problem
I am someone with an anxiety prone mindset something that comes with its own host of challenges. And among those are the anxious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors I battle with is the _"all or nothing"_ mindset, which is to say _"I get **everything** done or I get nothing done"._ And if I focus too much on one thing, I either get nothing else done on my check list, or I don't get that first thing done (like getting stuck). If I get overwhelmed by all tasks I need or want to do, I simply avoid and do nothing because I become stressed. I NEED to do it all but then I do none.

An hour of code challenge, and hour of drawing, an hour of gym, 30 minutes for driving/showering, 30 minutes eating, 30 minutes walking the dogs. That's already 4 hours worth of needed things to do at a minimum post work and post homework. For me? That feels overwhelming with no breathing room and honestly feels extremely offputting. And that's ignoring chores/errands!

**OH** And barring all that: I have [***chronic RSI***](https://physioworks.com.au/injuries-conditions-1/rsi-repetitive-strain-injury) in both my foreharms, wrists, and hands so frequent breaks  are absolutely ***important***. I need to do what is best for, and works best, for myself. So if I only wind up doing 10 minutes worth of the Daily challenge, to me, that's better than zero.

### Who Am I?

My name is Caroline Nolasco and I am a current student at [**General Assembly**](https://generalassemb.ly/) under their online flex software engineering program. I have been dabbling in HTML/CSS & Photoshop since I was 12 years old. It hasn't been until recently that I decided to take it to the next level to become a front end developer with a along with full stack development work. In these past few months I have refined my HTML/CSS skills and learned quite a bite of Javascript. That of which has leant itself to learning ***Node.JS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, React, and of recently: Ruby, SQL, and Ruby on Rails***

## My Plan

So what do I plan to do for the Code challenge outside homework and projects I already have for GA?

- **Complete Thought Challenges:** Javascript (and every now and then) Ruby problems set up sites such as [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) and [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges).
- **Javascript 30** - Build vanilla Javascript apps through through [the 30 day challenge](https://javascript30.com/).
- **Canvas** Learn to create and interact with Canvas to draw and create work on it
-  Going with the above, slowly re-work and rebuild my portfolio site using a combination of Photoshop, HTML, CSS, SASS, and React.
-  **Stretch Goals** Once I am out in the wild I plan on visiting courses from [Front End Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).
